AddressBookExample
==================

addressBookEx_list creates two associative arrays (contact book entries), a new array called "contacts" to contain the contact book entries, creates a function called "printPerson" to console.log select properties of the arrays, a function called "list" calling a for loop to run through the items in array "contacts" and calling the "printPerson" function, and then calls "list" to display the properties selected in "printPerson" of all items in the array "contacts."

addressBookEx_search creates two associative arrays (contact book entries), a new array called "contacts" to contain the contact book entries, creates a function called "printPerson" to console.log select properties of the arrays, creates a function called "search" to compare select properties of the arrays, and then calls "search" to display the properties selected in "printPerson" of all items in the array where the property matches the argument passed in "search".

addressBookEx_newentry creates two associative arrays (contact book entries), a new array called "contacts" to contain the contact book entries, creates a function called "printPerson" to console.log select properties of the arrays, a function called "list" calling a for loop to run through the items in array "contacts" and calling the "printPerson" function, a function called "add" to create a new object and add it to the array, and then calls "add" and "list."
